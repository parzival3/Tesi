The Internet of Things – IoT – has moved from fiction to reality.  By 2020 ,
there will be over 14 billion  network - enabled  devices,  according  to  the
International  Energy  Agency.  This  compares  to approximately 3.2 billion
people using the internet. IoT dramatically widens the internet’s scope from
people - operated computers towards autonomous smart devices.
